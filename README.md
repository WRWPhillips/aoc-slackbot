This is a slackbot I made for my company, KiteString Technical Services, in order to track a private company leaderboard for the Advent of Code calendar. It's written in node, and requires a slack webhook, an upstream Redis host, port, and url, an AOC cookie taken from inspecting the website, and your AOC user ID. 

A sample .env will have the following fields:
- WEBHOOK_URL
- REDIS_HOST
- REDIS_PORT
- REDIS_URL
- AOC_COOKIE
- AOC_BOARD_USER_ID
- PORT

This project was a ton of fun to make and it facilitated a lot of group cohesion and team building with all of us solving challenges together! I really recommend it. 

Note: The crons are laid out in the way they are because AoC has asked that users not send API requests more than once every ten minutes.
